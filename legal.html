</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>We use two main types of affiliate programs:
</strong></p><p>
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>1. Amazon affiliate links:</strong></span><br></p><p>DMS Groups is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon properties including, but not limited to, amazon.com, endless.com, myhabit.com, smallparts.com, or amazonwireless.com. Amazon offers a small commission on products sold through their affiliate links. Each of your purchases via our Amazon affiliation links supports our cause at no additional cost to you.
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Amazon and the Amazon logo are trademarks of Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">If a site links to an Amazon product (with a special code for affiliates embedded in the link), and a reader places an item in their "shopping cart" through that link within 24 hours of clicking the link, the site gets a small percentage of the sale. Amazon links are not “pay per click.” If you click on the product link and stay around Amazon and purchase something else, however, I will get commission on that sale.</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Anytime you see a link that looks like http://astore.amazon.com/...... or www.amazon.com/....</span><br></p><p>​it is an Amazon affiliate link.
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong><br></strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>2. Product affiliate links:</strong></span><br></p><p>These affiliate links work the same way: if you click the link and buy the product, then the site gets a percentage of the sale or some other type of compensation. Things like e-book bundles, e-courses, and online summit packages are usually affiliate links, also. Again, prices may different if you use these affiliate links due to any reason check before you buy anything, These links are not “pay per click.”
</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Editorial Disclosure</strong><br></p><p>The editorial content is not influenced by advertisements unless the content is sponsored content, in which case, the content will be clearly demarcated and/or identified with the title "Ad," "Advertisement," or "Sponsored", or a similar designation, indicating that the content is being provided by or on behalf of an advertiser or sponsor. Opinions expressed here are the product or services Providers alone, not belongs to those advertiser, sponsors or DMS Groups and have not been reviewed, approved, or otherwise endorsed by any of these entities.

It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
</p><p><strong>What are cookies?

The parties that set these third party cookies can recognise your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.  
</p><p><strong>Why do we use cookies?
</strong></p><p>We use first party and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Websites. Third parties serve cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes.  This is described in more detail below.

</strong></p><p>Cookies are not the only way to recognise or track visitors to a website.  We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”).  These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognise when someone has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail that we have sent them.  This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Websites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Websites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns.  In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.
</p><p><strong>Do you serve targeted advertising?
</strong></p><p>Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Websites. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to provide these. 
</p><p><strong>How can I control cookies?
</strong></p><p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.  You can exercise your cookie preferences by clicking on the appropriate opt-out links provided in the cookie table above.
</p><p>You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.
